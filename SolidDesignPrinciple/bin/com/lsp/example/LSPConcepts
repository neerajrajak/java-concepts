Liskov Substitution Principle
------------------------------

The Liskov substitution principle simply implies that when an instance of a class is passed/extended to another class, 
the inheriting class should have a use case for all the properties and behavior of the inherited class.

Problem
-------->
	In the example of come.lsp.example package,
	We have created an abstract class SocialMedia containing features to be implemented like
		- publishing post
		- chat with friends
		- send photos and videos
		- group videocall with friends
	
	While implementing those features we found that, even though instgram doesn't support group video call it needs to implemet that method.
	Hence, it voilates lsp principle since facebook doesn't have all the properties and behavior of inherited class.
	Same goes with Whatsapp where it doesn't support publishing post but needs to implement it.
	
Solution
--------->
	The solution to above problems is we have created multiple interfaces containing seperate features and the classes implement
	only those features which they need to.
