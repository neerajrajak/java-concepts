Open Close Principle
---------------------

	- The open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
	- This implies that such entities – classes, functions, and so on – should be created in a way that their core functionalities can be extended to 
	 other entities without altering the initial entity's source code.
	 
	 Problem
	 -------->
	  
	 - In BadOcpNotification class we have sendOtp method which accepts medium like email, sms, etc. and based on the medium
	 	it performs operation accordingly
	 - In future if user wants to add functionality related to whatsapp otp, it again needs to change the same class which voilates
	 	closed for modification principle.
	 	
	 Solution
	 -------->
	 
	 - To Solve above problem we have created an interface Notification Service
	 - So in future any new otp related functionality needs to be added it will just create the new class and implement 
	 	Notification interface and add its own implementation.
