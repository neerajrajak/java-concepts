Single Responsibility Principle
--------------------------------

The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program. 
As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".

Problem
-------->
	  In the BadBankService example we have this Bank Service performing multiple tasks 
	 	- Banking Services like deposit or withdraw
	 	- loan services like loan intrest
	 	- notificaton service like send OTP
	 	- print passbook related to transaction
	 
	 - In future if user wish to add one more loan intrest type like study loan he needs to make changes in this service
	 - Similary if user wish to add more otp feature.
	 
	 - So this class contains multiple features and to change any one feature we need to modify this class again and again
	  thus voilating single responsibility principle
	  
Solution
--------->
	- We have segregated service based on the functionality it is performing
		- LoanService: for loan related functionality
		- OtpService: for otp related functionality
		- BankService: for banking related functionality
		- PrinterService: for printing passbook related functionality
