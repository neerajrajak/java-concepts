Interface Segregation Principle
---------------------------------

The interface segregation principle states that the interface of a program should be split in a way that the 
user/client would only have access to the necessary methods related to their needs.
In short client should not be forced to implement methods which are not relevant to them.

Problem
-------->

	In our example, UpiPayment interface contains methods to send and receive money from banks as well as wallets.
	But Gpay doesn't support wallet related features so it is forced to implement those methods which is against ISP principle.
	
Solution
--------->
	We created two seperate interfaces one for bank payments and another for wallet payments.
	So features supported by classes are implemented accordingly.
